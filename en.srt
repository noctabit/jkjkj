- AAMIR TAAKI: It's no longer
the era of industry.

2
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:46,943
We're in a technological era,
fundamentally.

3
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:52,349
The fascists, they have
the resources.

4
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,785
But we have imagination.

5
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:58,555
We are making the tools to take
back our sovereignty.

6
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:02,159
When we make a giant
"fuck you" to the system,

7
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:03,693
it's breaking that stranglehold

8
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:08,732
on the tools of power
that's used against us.

9
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,435
The fascists always use
the narrative of,

10
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:13,970
"We are the white knights
in shining armor

11
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,039
"protecting against the threats.

12
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:21,311
We come here and we move out
the dark with pure whiteness."

13
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:23,713
That's a false narrative,

14
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:27,617
because there is corruption
in those castles.

15

The real base of

- KEANU REEVES NARRATING:
On January 13, 2015,

30
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,368
a criminal trial began

31
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,969
for the accused leader
of the Silk Road,

32
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,539
a black market in an area
of the internet

33
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:59,676
known as "the deep web."

34
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:02,846
The deep web is vast,
thousands of times larger

35
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:07,117
than the visible internet,
what's called the "surface web."

36
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,052
But the deep web is not a place.

37
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:12,689
It simply accounts for all of
the unindexed content online--

38
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,492
banking data, administrative
code for governments,

39
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:17,861
corporations and universities.

40
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:20,964
It's like looking under
the hood of the internet.

41
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,233
Over time, the deep web
became inhabited

42
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,368
by people of all types

43
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,904
who wanted to use this
terrain for privacy.

44
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:31,474
This hidden area of the deep web
is called the "dark net"

45
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,678
and it's accessible with
a software service called "Tor,"

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,947
originally developed
by the US military

47
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,916
and now open source
and publicly funded.

48
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:42,018
And while law enforcement
and the media

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,321
have painted a picture
that Tor and the dark net

50
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,423
are nefarious tools
for criminals,

51
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,225
it's important to
understand that they are

52
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:52,128
largely used for good by
government agencies, journalists

53
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,031
and dissidents around the world.

- REEVES NARRATING:
In the summer of 2011,

55
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,943
an ad for the Silk Road
appeared on the dark net.

56
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:10,847
The Silk Road was an underground
exchange for any type of goods,

57
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,017
but mostly it was
used for drugs.

58
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,586
There have always been
drug markets online,

59
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,655
but none with the scale,
sophistication

60
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,524
and ease of use
as the Silk Road.

61
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,761
It would not remain
underground for long.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,501
website which sells drugs,
forged documents

65
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,336
and even hit men.

66
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,438
It's called the Silk Road.

67
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,907
Just look at some
of the 13,000 items

68
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,477
offered through
that underground site.

69
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,780
Ultra clean cocaine,
clean and real LSD,

70
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:47,284
high grade MDMA,
also known as "Molly"--

71
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,386
all with fast and free shipping.

72
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:53,556
It generated roughly
$1.2 billion in sales

73
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:58,094
with nearly 960,000 users,
both buyers and sellers,

00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:01,097
in the US and more than a dozen
other countries worldwide.

known as Tor that pulls data

from thousands
of computers worldwide

79
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,979

by a virtual currency
called "Bitcoin."

82
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,753
Bitcoins offer anonymized
transactions,

83
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:27,724
which can be almost impossible
for the police to trace.

ecstasy, psychedelics,

and here they are.

86
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,536
So, oxycodone, all of those.

87
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,871
Codeine, black tar heroin.

88
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:43,707
You name it, they have it.

89
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,476
They're all listed in the...
in the light of day.

90
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:47,977
It's unbelievable.

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
- REEVES NARRATING:
The Silk Road's success

92
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:54,050
was largely due to an innovative
combination of Tor and Bitcoin.

93
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:57,320
Bitcoin is a technology that
uses cryptographic code

94
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,489
to create digital currency.

95
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,591
The sender transmits their
Bitcoin code through a ledger

96
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,928
called the "block chain"
to arrive at the recipient.

97
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,797
Bitcoin is not
perfectly anonymous.

98
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,433
But if used carefully, it
facilitates online purchases

99
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,802
without revealing identity.

100
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,472
Bitcoin was an ideal currency
for the Silk Road,

101
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:18,541
because it allows for anonymity
and is outside the control

102
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,944
of banks and governments.

103
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,185
- MAN: I really became
aware of the Silk Road

104
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:33,256
when Adrian Chen at Gawker,
uh, did his profile.

105
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,361
I think in a way,
that story, as much as

106
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:41,731
it documented the Silk Road,
it created the Silk Road, too.

107
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,467
I mean it...it drove so
many people to the site.

108
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,836
I think it probably was
an order of magnitude increase

109
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,838
in users on the Silk Road.

110
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,975
So from that point on, I felt
like I had missed the story

111
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:55,111
and I...I wanted the next big
story on the Silk Road.

112
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:59,716
But I was also just fascinated
with the community that was,

113
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:02,085
you know, being created there.

114
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:06,256
EBay doesn't have that
kind of user community.

115
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:10,794
This was like a really
tight-knit movement of people.

116
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:14,864
It was a fascinating thing
just to lurk around in.

117
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:18,635
- MAN: It's a certifiable,
one-stop shop for illegal drugs

118
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,704
that represents
the most brazen attempt

119
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,674
to peddle drugs online
that we have ever seen.

120
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:27,544
It's more brazen than anything
else by light-years.

121
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:31,014
- I mean, they had a really big,
you know, target on their back.

122
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:36,152
And they even had been taunting,
to some extent, law enforcement

123
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,923
and, you know, the powers that
be by doing this in the open.

124
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,326
And that's actually part of what
this marketplace is all about.

125
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:47,797
It's not so much about selling
drugs as much as it is to say,

126
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,901
to make a political
statement of sorts, right?

127
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,536
"This shouldn't be prohibited.

128
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,104
"We're free to do what we want

129
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,606
"and we have
the technology to do it.

130
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,174
So there."

- REEVES NARRATING:
The news around the Silk Road

132
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:01,177
came almost entirely

133
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,546
from law enforcement
and government officials

134
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,715
with little insight from those

135
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,517
who were behind
the market itself.

136
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,086
So the core architects
and vendors of the Silk Road

137
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:13,823
were sought out using encryption
keys to verify their identities

138
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,426
and preserving their anonymity.

139
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:19,429
This is the first time
they have spoken publicly.

- REEVES NARRATING:
The Silk Road didn't appear

142
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,381
to have a single leader.

143
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,850
There were the regular posts
from the systems administrator,

144
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,286
but otherwise the service
appeared to be

145
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,888
primarily community-run.

146
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,424
Then on February 5, 2012,
after a highly successful

147
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,026
first year of business,

148
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,195
the Silk Road administrator
made an announcement...

149
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,708
- You're the Dread Pirate
Roberts, admit it.

150
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,243
- With pride.

151
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:09,112
- REEVES NARRATING:
The Dread Pirate Roberts

152
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,613
was cribbed from the mythical
character from the novel

153
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:14,817
and film "The Princess Bride,"
and the choice was no accident.

154
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,853
In the original story
by William Goldman,

155
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,722
the Dread Pirate Roberts
was a nom de guerre handed down

156
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,725
from user to user and passed
along eternally.

157
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,260
- The man I inherited it from

158
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:26,095
was not the real
Dread Pirate Roberts either.

159
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,697
The real Roberts has
been retired 15 years

160
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,532
and I have been
Roberts ever since.

161
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:31,668
I shall retire and hand
the name over to someone else.

162
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,470
- REEVES NARRATING: This Dread
Pirate Roberts, or DPR,

163
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,373
would come to spearhead
the Silk Road forums and was

164
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,510
generally assumed to be the
creator and owner of the site.

165
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,545
- The Dread Pirate Roberts
to me seemed to be

166
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,815
kind of the most interesting
figure in that whole world.

167
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,184
On the Silk Road forums,
he was constantly posting

168
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:51,821
these manifestos and love
letters to his users

169
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,424
and Libertarian
philosophical treaties.

170
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:57,994
And he even had like this, uh,
Dread Pirate Roberts book club

171
00:09:58,096 --> 00:10:01,197
where he hosted discussions
of Austrian economics

172
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:04,000
and free market philosophy.

173
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:06,402
At the same time,
nobody knew who he was.

174
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:09,172
He had never spoken
to the press before.

175
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:13,042
I approached him on the Silk
Road forum mid-2012 and, uh,

176
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:16,179
started kind of just like trying
to persuade him to talk,

177
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,815
chipping away at him and just
bugging him constantly.

178
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,021
- GREENBERG:
The actual trigger,

179
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,990
I think that made him
decide to talk

180
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:30,393
was this competing dark
website called "Atlantis."

181
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,729
They were really
much more aggressive

182
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,999
in their marketing
than the Silk Road.

183
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:39,402
They put out this YouTube video
advertising Atlantis

184
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:44,173
as the...the new, better
dark web drug site.

185
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,442
So when I went back to
the Dread Pirate Roberts

186
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,945
and said, "You know,
I'm going to do this story.

187
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,447
It can either be about Atlantis
or it can be about you,"

188
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,283
I think he realized that,
you know, that...

189
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,586
He was a savvy business
guy who realized

190
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,321
he had to talk at that point.

191
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,423
He did have a kind
of political message

192
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,325
that he wanted to get out,
and I could see that

193
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,560
in what he was posting
on the forums.

194
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,496
So I kind of played up to that
and I told him like,

195
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:09,165
"I can be the...the vessel
for you to talk about

196
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,000
what the Silk Road
really represents,"

197
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:12,802
and I think that
that appealed to him.

198
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,070
So it took eight months,

199
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,738
but finally he did agree
to an interview.

200
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:21,144
- GREENBERG: Of course he...
he didn't tell me anything

201
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:25,014
about himself--where he lives,
you know, his age, identity,

202
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:27,483
uh, anything that could
be remotely identifying.

210
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,972
- He was incredibly
secretive, of course,

211
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:53,076
about the inner workings
of the Silk Road and,

212

of course.

213

309
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:46,335
And so we must provide
the underlying tools,

310
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:47,603
secret cryptographic codes

311
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:49,338
that the government
couldn't spy on

312
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,475
to everyone as a sort
of use of force.

313
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:56,212
And a government no matter
how hard it tries,

314
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,680
if the cyphers are good,

315
00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:00,950
uh, cannot break into your
communications directly.

316
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,686
- Force of authority
is derived from violence.

317
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,087
One must acknowledge
with cryptography,

318
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,922
no amount of violence will ever
solve a math problem.

319
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,125
- ASSANGE: Exactly.
- And this is the important key.

320
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:10,826
It doesn't mean you
can't be tortured.

321
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:13,062
It doesn't mean that they can't
try to bug your house

322
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,663
or subvert it in some way,

323
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,132
but it means if they find
an encrypted message

324
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,234
it doesn't matter if they have
the force of the authority

325
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,602
behind everything that they do.

326
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,304
They cannot solve
that math problem.

327
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,174
- This movement is not
about the destruction of law.

328
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:29,378
- CROWD: This movement is not
about the destruction of law.

329
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,882
- It is about
the construction of law.

330
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,283
- GREENBERG: These are guys
who want to create

331
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,919
encryption tools that
everybody can use.

332
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,788
It's not just for the elite.

333
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,490
It's...it's trying to shift
the way that the internet works

334
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:45,161
to provide secrecy and anonymity
and privacy to everyone,

335
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:49,498
you know, so like, um, it's
a much more populist movement.

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,635
- There is a community
of people in the security

337
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,938
and cryptography space
who want to live in a world

338
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,674
where the government cannot
record their emails,

339
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,609
cannot listen to
their telephone calls,

340
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,645
cannot see who they're
spending time with.

341
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,047
And they're trying
to build tools.

342
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:07,616
They're trying to build
protocols and services

343
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,885
that can facilitate
that kind of anonymous

344
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:11,954
and private exchange
of information.

345
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,023
- I actually think this
all comes down to

346
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,492
wanting to live a free life.

347
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,929
And the recognition which really
predates all technology,

348
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,399
that an observed life is not
a completely free life,

349
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:27,036
that a zone of privacy
is just a core human value.

350
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:32,074
And the technology to me
is just an incarnation

351
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:34,210
of those basic human values.

352
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:37,880
And I think that the people who
are trying to build currencies

353
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:40,483
that are free of tracking
and government control

354
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:43,319
and technologies that let you
have a private conversation

355
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:48,190
and those kinds of things are
just people who are seeing that

356
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:53,062
the technology can both enable
and disable that space.

357
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:56,699
- MAN: There are more
cypherpunks than ever before.

358
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,335
They want to entirely cripple

359
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,237
the government's ability
to enforce law.

360
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:04,607
They want cryptography
to make the rules

361
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,876
instead of law enforcement.

362

- REEVES NARRATING: Cody Wilson
is a crypto-anarchist

363
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,947
best known for developing
the Liberator,

364
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,782
a 3D printable gun

365
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,619
that was downloaded
100,000 times in two days.

366
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,587
- When a group of
baby boomers are told,

367
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,623
okay now 3D printers
will print guns,

368
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,525
they can do nothing but say,

369
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,560
"Well, it's been nice living
in the world I used to know."

370
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,562
We want to question
the very foundation,

371
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,697
evacuate the very foundation

372
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,802
that this order, moral, ethical,
political, is founded on.

- WILSON: To see beyond
good and evil

375
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,141
and to allow something
else to happen.

376
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,510
This is where the figure of DPR
is so interesting to me.

377
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:43,412
Like is he a liberal?

378
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,381
Like is he a Misesian
like he says he is?

379
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,850
Oh, he believes in Libertarian
market principles,

380
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,852
and you know man against
the state and all these...

381
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,054
these principles
of freedom and axioms of...

382
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,822
Or...or is he someone else?

383
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,824
Like...like who I hope
he is or someone

384
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,860
like I would try
to hope to be,

385
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,828
who's just looking for
a way, a mechanism,

386
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,097
to help peek beyond good
and evil a little bit.

387
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,634
And is he more enthusiastic
about what he's...

388
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:10,005
what he's allowed to be opened
up, the doors he's opening.

389
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:11,674
- GREENBERG: Of course,
there will be

390
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,842
a dark side to the dark web.

391
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,711
And if we want to enable this...

392
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,313
this true crypto-
anarchic future,

393
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:19,381
anyone who's working on that,
I think, has to reckon with

394
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:23,919
the fact that they're going to
be enabling really nasty things

395
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:27,189
along with this kind of
information freedom revolution

396
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,358
that they're taking part in.

397
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,828
- REEVES NARRATING: By August
2012, business was booming.

398
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,231
The Silk Road had become
a thriving, anonymous

399
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,866
and unregulated black market.

400
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,935
The internet being
used in this way,

401
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,571
posed a major threat
to the government,

402
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:44,039
greater perhaps
than selling drugs.

403
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,275
- Even as a...a law
enforcement officer,

404
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:51,046
I still wouldn't know where to
go and buy crack on the streets

405
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:54,750
or buy heroin, but I do know
how to go online and find it.

406
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,619
It's downloading some software
and...and the next thing

407
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,555
you know you're there
and you can purchase a service

408
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:01,023
or drugs very easily.

409
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,093
- MALE NEWSCASTER: Since
when does a teenager

410
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:06,662
become obsessed with
the daily mail delivery?

411
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:10,532
Fidgeting and pacing made
this Fisher's mom suspicious.

412
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:13,535
So when her family's mail
arrived, she grabbed it

413
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,005
and found a cartoon DVD box
addressed to her son

414
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,708
with something extra--
a package of white crystals.

415
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,744
So she confronted
her 14-year-old

416
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:24,146
and both their lives
changed forever.

417
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:27,583
- I don't think anybody really
cared in law enforcement

418
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,984
until Senator Schumer went,

419
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:30,986
"Oh, my God, we've gotta do
something about this."

420
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,422
- Today I'm calling on the DEA
and the Department of Justice

421
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:37,159
to immediately shut this site
down before more damage is done.

422
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,194
- SHIPLEY: Because if you think
about what law enforcement

423
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,564
at the federal level has
to do to even start a case,

424
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,733
I don't think this case
would have been started

425
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:46,902
if it wasn't for some
political impetus by, you know,

426
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:49,505
a senator saying,
"We need to look into this."

427
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,774
- The FBI today shut down
what it's calling

428
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,909
the most sophisticated
internet site

429
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:56,512
in the business of
selling hard drugs,

430
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,248
including heroin,
cocaine and LSD.

431
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,717
Anyone trying to log
on to the website today

432
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:04,887
found this notice:
"Shut down by the FBI."

433
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,889
- MALE NEWSCASTER: It was
a sophisticated electronic

434
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:10,759
smokescreen and it took federal
agents almost two years.

435
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:12,761
- WOMAN: They were able to
infiltrate the site,

436
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,563
but they made some of these
purchases themselves

437
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,498
using undercover identities.

438
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,767
- The secretive
Dread Pirate Roberts

439
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,804
was arrested in the most
unlikely of places--

440
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:25,007
this local public library in
this San Francisco neighborhood.

441
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,844
- MALE NEWSCASTER:
The FBI seized $3.6 million

442
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:33,082
of Bitcoin's biggest haul
in its five-year history.

443
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:51,066
- When the criminal complaint
first appeared in October,

444
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:56,338
it describes this 29-year-old
kid named Ross Ulbricht.

445
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,508
Not only do they say that he has
run this billion-dollar plus

446
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,811
black market conspiracy and they
accuse him of drug trafficking

447
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:06,482
and money laundering and somehow
computer hacking charges,

448
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,717
as well, which is
something that I had

449
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:11,253
never associated with
the Silk Road.

450
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:15,491
But then also in this criminal
complaint there is outlined

451
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,926
his plot to pay for the murders

452
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:22,131
of a potential informant
and a blackmailer.

453
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,966
- MALE NEWSCASTER: It seems
at least one Silk Road user

454
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,601
threatened to reveal
the identities

455
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,703
of thousands of others.

456
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:30,439
So investigators say
Ulbricht tried to execute

457
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,374
a Murder-For-Hire on that user,

458
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:36,979
offering $150,000 to a would-be
hit man because--

459
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,623
- It threw me for a loop.

460
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,491
It was really not
the Dread Pirate Roberts

461
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:51,193
that I had ever imagined.

462
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:53,295
This connection between
Ross Ulbricht,

463
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:54,930
who plenty of evidence suggests

464
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:56,799
that he was involved
in the Silk Road.

465
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,767
They, after all,
seized his laptop

466
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:00,636
while he was logged
in to the Silk Road.

467
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,638
He was caught red-handed.

468
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,706
But these two personalities,
these two personas,

469
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,910
do seem to be almost
schizophrenic.

470
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:11,013
It's so difficult to imagine
that they are the same person.

471
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:14,450
- And so the FBI's whole case
is based on the idea

472
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:18,020
if they can show that Dread
Pirate Roberts is Ross Ulbricht?

473
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,422
- Right. That's...that's
the most important part, right?

474
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:21,990
Because he was trying to hide

475
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:23,859
his identity
on the site as well.

476
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,427
So the first thing
they're gonna have to do

477
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,865
is definitively link him as
the person who runs the site.

478
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:36,972
- Oh, man, it was like it
was yesterday, actually.

479
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:42,077
I was on my computer and,
um, I was on Facebook.

480
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,715
And there's this guy that I know
and he's very into like Bitcoin

481
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,084
and cryptocurrencies
and stuff like that.

482
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:53,889
He posted this article and it
says, "Ross Ulbricht Arrested."

483
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,859
And I pull up Lyn's, uh,
g-chat and I'm like,

484
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,428
"What is going on?
Like why is--"

485
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,063
And I'm looking at Ross' page--

486
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,232
picture, you know,
about being arrested.

487
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:04,800
What is this?

488
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:06,568
She says, "We don't even know.

489
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,270
We're leaving Costa Rica
right now."

490
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:11,473
I mean, they were on their way,
but it blew my mind.

491
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,475
I mean totally blew my mind.

492
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:19,815
- REEVES NARRATING:
Ross William Ulbricht grew up

493
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:23,619
in a suburb of Austin,
the only son of Kirk and Lyn

494
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,921
with an older sister
named Callie.

495
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:29,057
It's a loving, tight-knit,
middle-class family.

496
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,927
The Ulbrichts earn their income
from properties they built

497
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,130
and rent on
the Costa Rican coast.

498
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,134
Ross was an avid outdoorsman,
an Eagle Scout like his father,

499
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:42,504
and displayed
an early aptitude for math.

500
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:43,906
Ross earned a full scholarship

501
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:48,076
to the University of Texas
at Dallas studying Physics.

502
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:52,514
He graduated in 2006 and then
won another full scholarship

503
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,116
to Penn State
to pursue a Masters

504
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,119
in Material Science
and Engineering.

505
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:00,022
It was at Penn State that
Ross began a deep interest

506
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:03,926
in Libertarianism, particularly
the work of Ludwig von Mises

507
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:06,161
and the Austrian School
of Economics.

508
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:09,364
Yet by 2009,
having completed his Masters,

509
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:12,200
Ross seemed to be having
a change of life plan

510
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,603
telling his mother
he no longer had an interest

511
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,838
in pursuing a career in science

512
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,875
and instead wanted to
become an entrepreneur.

513
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,944
- REEVES NARRATING:
Ross moved back to Austin

514
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,513
and opened his own used book
company, Good Wagon,

515
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:27,215
donating a portion of
the proceeds to an inner city

516
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:31,119
youth program and to
a prison literacy project.

517
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:33,855
- I remember him saying,
when we had coffee,

518
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,325
the last time we saw each other,
I remember him saying

519
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:40,262
that he wished he had joined
a fraternity in college.

520
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,297
And I remember saying,
"Well, that's surprising."

521
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:45,067
You know, I didn't really
understand that perspective,

522
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:49,571
um, and I just remember him
thinking, well he focused a lot

523
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:55,010
on his studies in school and
maybe didn't create the social

524
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:59,481
network that he was looking
for, um, in...in school.

525
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:03,719
But as far as where we saw each
other going or where we saw

526
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:09,992
ourselves going, um, I think
we both had a strong desire

527
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:12,961
to be in control
of our destiny.

528
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,097
You know, again like when
he started the book company,

529
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,932
uh, totally natural.

530
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,967
Not even something that
I would have questioned,

531
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:20,802
where there are
a lot of people

532
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,738
that would never start
their own business.

533
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,473
But for Ross, sure,
you know, why not?

534
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:26,208
- REEVES NARRATING:
But the business floundered

535
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,477
and Ross eventually
shut it down.

536
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:31,680
And if a post on his LinkedIn
page was any indication,

537
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,849
Ross had experienced
a kind of epiphany

538
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,451
on the next way forward.

539
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:39,354
Ulbricht wrote,
"Now my goals have shifted.

540
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:42,290
"I want to use economic theory
as a means to abolish

541
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:45,460
"the use of coercion and
aggression amongst mankind.

542
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:49,398
"To that end, I am creating
an economic simulation to give

543

"people a first-hand experience
of what it would be like

544
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:55,637
to live in a world without
the systemic use of force."

545
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,773
From this moment,
in late 2010,

546
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,175
Ross became something
of a free spirit,

547
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,577
eventually leaving
his parents' home in Austin

548
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,280
to live with his sister Callie
in Sydney, Australia

549
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:07,716
and then returning
briefly to Austin.

550
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:10,485
Throughout this period,
as far as his family knew,

551
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:12,254
Ross' means of employment

552
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:15,724
was working on freelance
projects in computer finance.

553
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:18,860
- I am Rene Pinnell, age 29.

554

Today is December 6, 2012

555
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:25,400
and we are in the Jewish
Contemporary Art Museum,

556
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:32,107
and relationship to partner
is best friend.

557
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:35,177
So, Ross, how did you come
to live in San Francisco?

558
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,214
- Uh, you twisted
my arm until I said,

559
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:42,250
"Ah, fine I'll come."
[laughing]

560
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:45,087
I get a phone call from Rene,
"Ross, call me up.

561
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,422
I've got an opportunity
for you."

562
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,157
I'm like, "Okay."

563
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:51,159
He's like, "Yeah, I'm doing
a startup here in San Francisco.

564
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,695
Um, I want you to
be a part of it."

565
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,231
The more I thought about it,
and the more he, um,

566
00:28:56,333 --> 00:29:01,069
laid out the pros
and cons, uh...uh...

567
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,871
the more it all just
seemed like cosmic

568
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:07,375
and the right thing to do.
So, um, yeah.

569
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,211
I bought my ticket
and two weeks later

570
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,880
I showed up at his doorstep.

571

- REEVES NARRATING: As Ross
Ulbricht was making his way

572
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,452
from Australia to Austin,
and eventually to San Francisco,

573
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:20,522
the Silk Road was online
and growing steadily.

574
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:21,957
So naturally it sparked
the attention

575
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,792
of federal law enforcement

576
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:25,560

housed in the old Customs House
in Baltimore, Maryland.

inspectors in Seattle

and Customs and Border
Protection, uh,

intercepting mail shipments
coming from overseas

582
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,411
full of drugs, full of,
uh, full of currency.

583
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,881
And one thing
that happens is

584
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:48,216
they all lead
back to the Silk Road.

to do below 10 kilos,"
the agent wrote.

613
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,962
DPR offered to help
find a buyer for nob

614
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:43,465
and allegedly turned to one
of his most trusted partners

615
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,735
known only as "chronicpain"
to put the deal together.

616
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,371
Chronicpain had been
one of the core administrators

617
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:51,039
of the Silk Road
from the beginning,

618
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:53,475
a frequent contributor
to the forums who shared

619
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:57,245
the Silk Road vision for
reducing harm in the drug trade.

620
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:59,714
But these halcyon days
were about to end.

621
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:02,884
In order to facilitate
this drug deal,

622
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,553
chronicpain gave the informant
his home address.

623
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:08,390
Federal agents immediately
apprehended chronicpain

624
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:11,760
at his Salt Lake City home
and were surprised to discover

625
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:15,964
that this 47-year-old family man
named Curtis Clark Green

626
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:18,066
was a dark net criminal.

627
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:19,701
- At some point they're going
to catch one of those people.

628
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:21,636
And what do you do
in a typical drug case?

629
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:24,272
You roll that person over
as a cooperating witness.

630
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:27,475
And in this case, one of them
they got really lucky

631
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,678
and he was an administrator
on the system.

632
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,680
- REEVES NARRATING:
Green had access to

633
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,249
other Silk Road users' accounts
and financial records,

634
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,251
including Dread Pirate Roberts.

635
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,320
"I have to assume he will sing,"

636
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:41,022
DPR wrote to nob,
the undercover agent.

637
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:42,357
"I'd like him beat up."

638
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,659
Then, the next day,
he allegedly wrote,

639
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:48,363
"Can you change the order to
execute rather than torture?"

640
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:50,365
A murder was staged.

641
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:53,501
And a photograph of Green's
bloody body was sent to DPR,

642
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:56,204
who paid for the hit
in Bitcoin.

643
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:58,907
There would be five more alleged
Murders-For-Hire,

644
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:02,544
including ordered hits against
a blackmailer, a scammer

645
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:05,580
and an apparent contract
with the Hells Angels.

646
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,582
The names of two
of these victims

647
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:09,417
were found to be fictitious.

648
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,585
And authorities have no evidence

649
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:13,188
of any murders
being carried out.

650
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,357
The alleged attempted
murder of Curtis Green

651
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,959
allowed the authorities
to obtain an indictment

652
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:19,427
against Dread Pirate Roberts,

653
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:21,529
charging him with drug offenses,

654
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,532
attempted witness murder
and Murder-For-Hire.

655
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:26,568
Of course, they still
had no idea

656
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,437
who the Dread Pirate Roberts
actually was.

657
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,474
So the embedded agents continued
to communicate with DPR,

658
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:34,876
and DPR continued to respond.

659
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,615
In June of 2013,
Ross moved into an apartment

660
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,817
that he found on Craigslist.

661
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,353
Allegedly, he did not give
his roommates his real name

662
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:47,655
and was known as Joshua Terrey.

663
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,892
At the same time,
IRS agent Gary Alford

664
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,294
was investigating the Silk Road

665
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,096
and through a simple Google
search was able to locate

666
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:58,633
an early email on the open
internet discussing the launch

667
00:33:58,735 --> 00:34:00,568
of the Silk Road marketplace

668
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,607
and connect that email to an
account owned by Ross Ulbricht.

669
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,542
One month later,
postal inspectors

670
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,879
at the Canadian border
seized a package of fake IDs

671
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:16,017
with Ross' image that were
en route to his home address.

672
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,889
Ross was visited at his
apartment by several DHS agents.

673
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:23,992
The agents handed Ross a false
California driver's license

674
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:26,628
that bore his picture,
but a different name.

675
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,998
Ulbricht denied ownership
or knowledge of the fake IDs,

676
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,601
and the agents simply left.

677
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:37,038
- If you suspect somebody
may be involved in a...

678
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,374
in a large-scale
criminal enterprise,

679
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,643
going and knocking on a door
with some, uh, you know,

680
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:45,180
some evidence of fake IDs
is important, uh,

681
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:48,049
because you can see
the guy face-to-face.

682
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:51,319
Uh, you may get some useful
information out of an interview.

683
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:54,022
You may or may not want to take
him into custody on the spot.

684
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:57,559
Let's sit back and let's, uh,
let's really go after this

685
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:01,529
in a...in a...you know, much
more global way, if you will,

686
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:04,566
uh, because there's a lot more
here than just one count of,

687
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:07,001
uh, you know, fake IDs.

688
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:08,903
- REEVES NARRATING: The next
big break in the case

689
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:11,039
would be achieved
by FBI agent Tarbell

690
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:14,042
and his cyber-crime team,
who had somehow located

691
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:17,612
the Silk Road servers
in Germany and Iceland.

692
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,214
How these hidden
servers were found

693
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:20,782
has been a matter
of controversy,

694
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:24,586
but the FBI had their own copy
of the Silk Road server,

695
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:27,789
and now they hoped to finally
unmask the Dread Pirate Roberts.

696
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:43,705
- REEVES NARRATING:
Over the course of a year,

697
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:47,575
a Chicago-based agent from the
DHS named Jared Der-Yeghiayan

698
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,711
had been embedded
in the Silk Road,

699
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:53,681
now posing as a high-ranking
moderator named "cirrus."

700
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:55,950
With both the evidence
connecting Ross to the launch of

701
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,887
the Silk Road and the incident
with the fake IDs,

702
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:02,924
Ross became one of
the primary suspects.

703
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,993
On October 1st in
a coordinated effort

704
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:09,664
between Der-Yeghiayan from
the DHS and Tarbell's FBI squad,

705
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:11,799
a sting operation was launched.

706
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:14,202
According to
Der-Yeghiayan's testimony,

707
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:16,804
he staked out Ross'
new residence.

708
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,706
And using his
pseudonym of cirrus,

709
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:20,942
Der-Yeghiayan initiated
a conversation

710
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:23,111
on the Silk Road with DPR.

711
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:26,414
Moments later, Ross went
to the Glen Park Library,

712
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:28,883
apparently to use their Wi-Fi.

713
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,119
And when Der-Yeghiayan
saw that DPR was logged back

714
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:33,121
into the Silk Road,

715
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:36,191
he gave the order for Tarbell
and his squad to move in.

716
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:39,127
- It's an excitement that you
couldn't even buy off Silk Road.

717
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,996
Uh, all the drugs you could buy
on the site, you...you...you...

718
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:44,966
It's not the same excitement
as catching the guy.

719
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:45,934
It's an adrenaline rush.

720
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,936
- REEVES NARRATING:
Ross was apprehended

721
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,938
before he could
encrypt his laptop.

722
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,473
He was allegedly logged into a
Silk Road administration panel

723
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:55,677
for customers
needing DPR's attention.

724
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,946
- He was a dream for drug users,

725
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,749
because he was very technically
adept and he was able to hide

726
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:05,119
both the website
that he put together

727
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:10,391
and the actual sales of illegal
drugs that the drug sellers

728
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:13,361
would, uh, make on his website.

729
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:15,463
- REEVES NARRATING: The Silk
Road was seized and shut down,

730
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,265
and charges were
announced against

731
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,568
a number of core partners
and vendors from the site.

732
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,338
Ross was held for over a month
in a jail in Oakland,

733
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,174
awaiting extradition
to New York.

734
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,875
Ross's family was able to raise

735
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:30,211
over a million dollars
for his bail.

736
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,680
But the prosecution argued
that due to the alleged

737
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:36,517
Murders-For-Hire, Ross was
too dangerous to release

738
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,820
and so his bail was denied.

739
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,755
- LYN ULBRICHT: I thought
it was the wrong decision.

740
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:43,157
He wouldn't have been a flight
risk and he's never been

741
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,460
and is not a danger to anyone.

742
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,214
- ALEX WINTER:
There was more than one person

743
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,182
using the DPR account?

744
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:35,443
- REEVES NARRATING:
The data seized from

745
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:38,146
the Silk Road servers included
all internal private messages,

746
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:41,916
which revealed that many people
collectively ran the site.

747
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:44,719
One vendor with the user
name "Variety Jones"

748
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:47,455
was active from the beginning
of the Silk Road.

749
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:50,725
Jones gave many of the orders
for running the Silk Road,

750
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,528
even instructing the systems
administrator to create

751
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,531
the Dread Pirate Roberts
persona.

752
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,533
But Ross Ulbricht remained

753
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:01,836
the primary focus
of the investigation.

754
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,906
Ross has been incarcerated
for over a year

755
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:06,274
in the Metropolitan
Detention Center

756
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,276
in Brooklyn awaiting trial.

757
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:11,946
Six weeks of that time was
in solitary confinement.

758
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:16,150
Ross plead not guilty and denies
being the Dread Pirate Roberts.

759
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,052
His trial was set for

760
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:21,055
November 10, 2014
in New York City.

761
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:25,126
If convicted, Ross faces
a minimum sentence of 30 years

762
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:30,398
with a maximum sentence
of life in prison.

763
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,434
- WOMAN: Are you taking a video?
- PINNELL: Mmm-hmm.

764
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:34,902
- ULBRICHT: He's a hairy fucker.

765
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:37,739
- PINNELL: These big guys
are generally not too, uh...

766
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:39,741
I would let him
off somewhere.

767
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:41,743
- WOMAN: [gasps]
- PINNELL: Where is he?

768
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:44,479
- You know it's hard.
It's...it's hard on a family.

769
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:47,582
It really is, especially when
you love that person so much

770
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:49,951
and you believe in them so much

771
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,820
and you have such a daunting
Goliath of an opponent.

772
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,690
It's, uh, challenging.

773
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,859
It's kind of like a death,
in a way, when you go like,

774
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:59,127
"No, that can't be true,"

775
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:00,895
and then you're like,
"Oh, yeah, it's true."

776
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,631
And you go through
that kind of shock.

777
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:05,767
His dad, my husband,
um, of course,

778
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,268
he's trying to keep
our business going

779
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,803
so we have a livelihood.

780
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:11,539
And, um, his sister
is in, um, Australia

781
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,641
and she's been helping,
too, from there.

782
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,343
- I'm Ross' sister
and I can tell you

783
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:18,813
he has been a man of his word
and honor all his life.

784
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:21,482
I was shocked to hear
the news of his arrest,

785
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:23,151
but felt even more dismayed

786
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,953
at what the media was writing
about him, not even knowing him.

787
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:31,092
- LYN ULBRICHT: You know,
I read things by people

788
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:34,829
who have not a clue
who Ross really is.

789
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:38,466
He's been tried
and convicted in the media.

790
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,135
Nothing has been proven at all.

791
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:43,304
I don't know what's happened to
the presumption of innocence

792
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:45,973
in this country, but it is
a constitutional right here

793
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,376
that we are innocent
until proven guilty.

794
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:52,346
Ross sent me this picture of
himself about a week ago.

795
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:55,082
It was taken a couple of
weeks ago in prison.

796
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:56,951
I guess sometimes they go around

797
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:58,986
and take pictures
for the families.

798
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:02,056
He is doing well, uh, as well
as can be expected,

799
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:05,326
of course,
under the circumstances.

800
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:08,963
And finally, after
five months of delays,

801
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:11,232
he has had access
to the discovery,

802
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:13,901
the evidence that
the prosecution has.

803
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:17,004
And so he's been working very
hard going through that.

804
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:19,240
We are asking the,
uh, prosecution,

805
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:23,277
"How did you find the server,"
and they're not saying.

806
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:26,180
Um, we have to know how they
found the server in order to see

807
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:29,717
if Ross' Fourth Amendment
rights have been violated.

808
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,420
And how would anyone know
if the evidence had been

809
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:33,788
tampered with or anything else

810
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,859
if it's not revealed
how they found the server?

811
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:41,195
There were 14 searches
and seizures in this case,

812
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:44,966
which is a...
a fishing expedition

813
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:48,135
into a person's total property.

814
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:50,438
Unlimited rummaging through
all of their things

815
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,273
to see what they can find.

816
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,076
- When the criminal complaints
first appeared in...in October,

817
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:58,613
I think the supporters
of the Dread Pirate Roberts

818
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,781
and the Silk Road
just scattered.

819
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:02,350
Because suddenly this thing
that had seemed like

820
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:06,020
an idealistic community
built around non-violence

821
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:08,956
and, you know,
Libertarian free commerce,

822
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:12,326
suddenly seemed instead like
this bloody criminal conspiracy.

823
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:18,199
And a guy who probably otherwise
would have been a kind of, uh,

824
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:21,335
political cause célèbre,
who...who would have had

825
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:24,105
all of these supporters
calling for his freedom,

826
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:28,609
instead was treated as a...
was an immediate pariah.

827
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,211
He was seen as a criminal.

828
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:35,516
- So there's a lot of, um,
circumstantial, uh, evidence,

829
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:36,817
if you want to call it that.

830
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,754
There's a lot of technical bits
and pieces involved.

831
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:42,089
It got really crazy
in the middle of that.

832
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:44,625
Sort of one thing is taking down
this online drug market.

833
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:46,494
Another thing
is pinning a number of

834
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,329
Murders-For-Hires on top of it.

835
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:50,331
It just seems really,
really far-fetched.

836
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,500
- MALE NEWSCASTER:
The 29-year-old seemingly

837
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:55,770
clean-cut entrepreneur
was living a secret life

838
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,638
as a digital drug lord.

839
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,874
- They're claiming that he's
living in a manner of a...

840
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,175
of a head of a cartel.

841
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:02,643
The distinctions
between Ross Ulbricht

842
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,211
and the head of a cartel,

843
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:05,980
you don't have to see
too many movies to...

844
00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:08,516
to recognize what
the differences are here.

845
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:11,185
- GREENBERG: Then when
the indictment finally came out,

846
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,220
there were suddenly
no charges around

847
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,389
these Murder-For-Hire
accusations,

848
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:17,124
only the drug trafficking

849
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:19,660
and money laundering
and computer hacking.

850
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:21,262
- They had six charges.

851
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:24,699
They used them against him
to deprive him of bail

852
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,535
and yet two and a half
months later, uh,

853
00:43:27,637 --> 00:43:29,270
the prosecutor
didn't indict him.

854
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:33,608
What they did instead was they
called it an "uncharged crime."

855
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,243
Well, if something's a crime,
don't you charge someone for it?

856
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,647
And if it's not a crime,
why is it there--

857
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:42,383
because it's
prejudicial to a jury

858
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:45,386
to have that sitting
there unproven just...

859
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:47,888
just smearing him.

860
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:53,127
- The portrayal they want
is of someone who they could

861
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:55,563
present to a jury
of not having redeeming value.

862
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:59,200
It's a way of poisoning
the atmosphere so that the jury

863
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:03,704
doesn't focus on the
allegations, but focuses on this

864
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:06,674
atmospheric that the government
has created that in some sense

865
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:10,111
is a diversion appealing to
the emotional aspect of it

866
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:11,946
so that if the proof is weak,

867
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:13,614
the benefit of the doubt
doesn't go to the defendant,

868
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:15,750
where it belongs, under
the presumption of innocence,

869
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:17,451
but it goes to
the government because,

870
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:19,186
hey, there are these awful
things lurking out there

871
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:21,122
which aren't part of what
we're supposed to find.

872
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:22,990
The government doesn't
have to prove them

873
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:24,525
beyond a reasonable doubt,

874
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:26,127
but they've injected them
in the case in a way

875
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:29,930
that is toxic to
an impartial evaluation of

876
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:32,199
what the evidence is on
the charged crimes.

877
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:34,035
So people come in with
a preconceived notion

878
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:36,604
and that's halfway
there to...to guilt.

879
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,272
- Previously, the Murder-
For-Hire was in there

880
00:44:38,374 --> 00:44:41,475
as a charge and then
it was dropped.

881
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:43,577
But it's not gone away.

882
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,080
It's included as what
they call an overt act

883
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:49,750
in the conspiracy and...
to sell drugs.

884
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:53,654
And so they actually made it
one of the things to support

885
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:57,825
the larger drug conspiracy
to either get a trial

886
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,326
or get him to plead.

887
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:00,828
- It seemed like
this bait and switch

888
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,366
that the government had accused
him in this almost informal way

889
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:09,303
of murder so that when
he was charged with these

890
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:11,005
non-violent crimes in the end,

891
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:13,541
he would still be seen
as a violent criminal.

892
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,910
I think that that has
really been effective in...

893
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:20,214
in coloring the portrait
of Ross Ulbricht.

894
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:24,685
- REEVES NARRATING:
Ever since Ross' arrest,

895
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:26,053
he and his best friend
Rene Pinnell

896
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:28,589
have remained in
regular contact.

897
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:31,459
Rene declined to give
substantive interviews

898
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:34,929
to the press for fear they would
be used against Ross in court,

899
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:38,466
but agreed to answer
questions via email.

900
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:18,272
- WOMAN: [laughing]

901
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:20,541
- ULBRICHT:
¶ I'm a little teapot ¶

902
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:23,010
¶ Short and stout ¶

903
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:26,046
¶ Here is my handle
here is my spout ¶

904
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:29,416
¶ When I get all steamed up
hear me shout ¶

905
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:32,720
¶ Tip me over
and pour me out ¶

906
00:46:32,822 --> 00:46:33,921
- WOMAN [off camera]
Yay!

907
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:36,791
- BOTH: [laughing]

908
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:39,360
- REEVES NARRATING: Because
of the severity of the charges,

909
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:42,596
Ross was not able to grant
an interview from prison,

910
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:43,664
which left only a scattering

911
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,467
of his personal
photographs and movies.

912
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,269
But from the exhaustive
discussions

913
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,070
with friends and family

914
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,339
and the public knowledge
of Ross's trajectory

915
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:54,341
from Physics
and Engineering major

916
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:57,077
to running a small home-spun
book-selling company,

917
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,480
it was difficult to understand
how he could possibly

918
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:02,082
have been the sole mastermind
of the Silk Road,

919
00:47:02,185 --> 00:47:04,451
a vast and complex
internet service

920
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:07,955
with over a million
users worldwide.

921
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:09,323
Ross was certainly
bright and studious

922
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:12,493
with a deep interest in
Libertarian economic theory,

923
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:14,628
which clearly echoed
the mandate and philosophy

924
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,698
of many of the posts
of the Dread Pirate Roberts.

925
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,968
But he had no experience
whatsoever in computer coding

926
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,270
or scaling large
internet companies.

927
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:26,040
So how did Ross connect
to what little is truly known

928
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,609
about the Dread Pirate Roberts?

929
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:32,112
DPR was motivated
by a pacifistic philosophy

930
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,849
and an agenda of creating
victimless exchange

931
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:36,784
and reduced harm
in the drug trade.

932
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:39,820
This ethos would be embraced
by the chief architects

933
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:41,255
and vendors of the Silk Road

934
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:44,458
and reverberate through
the entire community.

935
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:52,166
- [digitally-altered voice]

936
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:20,461
- REEVES NARRATING:
The Silk Road appeared to be

937
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:22,963
a successful experiment in
creating a pacifistic community,

938
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:26,600
overseen by a figurehead with
a deep-rooted ideology.

939
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:29,570
But these core ideals of
the Dread Pirate Roberts

940
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:33,007
were completely at odds with
the Murder-For-Hire allegations.

941
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:35,442
Did DPR become corrupted
and turn his back on

942
00:48:35,544 --> 00:48:38,812
the mandate of non-violence
and harm reduction?

943
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:41,682
Were there other people
using the DPR account

944
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:44,585
who were responsible
for these actions?

945
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:47,288
Or was there some other truth
behind these alleged

946
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:52,159
murder hits that
produced no victims?

947
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:01,702
- We don't know the first
piece of evidence

948
00:49:01,804 --> 00:49:05,873
that lead the feds down
this chain of investigation

949
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,375
to the San Francisco library

950
00:49:08,477 --> 00:49:10,844
where Ross Ulbricht
was arrested.

951
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,446
All we know is that
at some point they located

952
00:49:12,548 --> 00:49:15,549
the Silk Road servers
in a data center

953
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:17,885
in Iceland and imaged them.

954
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:21,855
They copied all the data off
of them, and seized them,

955
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,391
but we don't know how
they found those servers.

956
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:27,127
The whole idea of...of
the Silk Road was that it ran

957
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:28,796
as a Tor-hidden service,

958
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,165
which means that Tor protected
its physical location

959
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,033
and made it very difficult

960
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:34,835
to locate the computers
that ran it.

961
00:49:34,937 --> 00:49:40,507
So the mystery of how the FBI,
or the DEA, or possibly the NSA,

962
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:44,244
located those servers is still
unsolved and, in fact,

963
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:47,348
hasn't been mentioned in
any of the legal documents

964
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,284
surrounding
Ross Ulbricht's trial.

965
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:52,920
I think his defense has seized
on this as something

966
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:55,389
that the government
doesn't want to talk about.

967
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:58,492
And if that's the case,
then it does raise

968
00:49:58,594 --> 00:50:02,730
these Fourth Amendment issues
of...of can the government

969
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:04,832
use essentially
hacking techniques

970
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:08,202
to dig up evidence on
a criminal suspect?

971
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:10,938
And if so, what kinds
of warrant do they need?

972
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,307
If in fact there was some
kind of violation of

973
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:15,409
the Fourth Amendment,

974
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:17,611
in that initial part
of the investigation,

975
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:20,280
that really was the first
clue that lead them

976
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:23,083
down this entire chain to
the arrest of Ross Ulbricht,

977
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:24,618
it could be a giant problem

978
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,254
for the prosecution that then
taints every other piece

979
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:31,291
of evidence that
they found subsequently.

980
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:32,893
- The government has
prosecuted other people

981
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:39,299
for doing essentially what the
government did here, which is...

982
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:43,871
trying to get underneath
the public face of a website.

983
00:50:43,973 --> 00:50:46,573
And they have alleged that
getting that information

984
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:48,475
that's not supposed to
be publicly accessible

985
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:52,846
by sophisticated computer,
uh, inquiries or activities,

986
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:56,617
uh, that that is a...
a violation of federal law.

987
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,319
And that's why they always say,
we didn't do anything wrong,

988
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:00,988
we didn't do anything
in violation,

989
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,490
but they really know what's
stake here, because they've

990
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:05,993
actually prosecuted people
for the same thing.

991
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:09,530
And the government's affidavit,
the affidavit from Agent Tarbell

992
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:12,166
about how they got to
the Silk Road servers

993
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,435
has been met with
incredulousness

994
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:17,738
by the internet community.

995
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,307
- MAN: The Tarbell declaration,
to put it politely,

996
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:23,644
seems vaguely disconnected
from the truth.

997
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:26,613
If you...depending on which
security expert you ask,

998
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:30,884
you will get it's vaguely
disconnected to the truth

999
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,219
to something filled with...

1000
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:35,222
it is a massive pile
of bovine excrement.

1001
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:39,259
What Tarbell's story was is he
was typing away at his computer,

1002
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:41,662
visiting the Silk Road website

1003
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:44,698
and the CAPTCHA was
transmitted in the clear,

1004
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,134
and he somehow
saw the IP packets

1005
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:49,169
go directly to the server.

1006
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:52,506
And so he then connects to that
server and gets the CAPTCHA.

1007
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:54,975
Game over--they found
the backend server.

1008
00:51:55,077 --> 00:52:01,615
Unfortunately, this was playing
fast and loose with the truth.

1009
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:06,053
Because the logs provided
to the defense show that

1010
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:10,991
what Tarbell found was
not the CAPTCHA image,

1011
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:14,361
but instead a php MyAdmin page.

1012
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,197
The server was running some
stuff over the clear,

1013
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,866
but not the CAPTCHA.

1014
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:24,771
So Tarbell's story doesn't mesh
with the FBI's own evidence.

1015
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:27,641
- MAN: They hacked the servers
and with that access

1016
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:29,476
could essentially
do whatever they wanted.

1017
00:52:29,578 --> 00:52:31,178
Given just the institutional
pressure to...

1018
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,746
to take this thing down,

1019
00:52:32,848 --> 00:52:35,649
it's naive to think
that they didn't.

1020
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,551
- WILSON: Of course,
it's on the table

1021
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:39,453
that this is how
they discovered him.

1022
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:41,255
I mean he was dealing with Tor.

1023
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:42,923
He was dealing with
all these technologies

1024
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:45,058
which we know are the subject
of NSA investigations,

1025
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,693
as revealed by Edward Snowden.

1026
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:49,396
It's at least reasonable
to assume that there's been

1027
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,532
this kind of parallel
construction or interference

1028
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,667
or like not playing
by the rules that the state

1029
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:55,135
deals out for you to play with.

1030
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:58,205
But then again, we all know
that it deals the cards.

1031
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:00,507
Uh, it...it runs
the game anyway.

1032
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:02,276
It's...it's not even...

1033
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:05,279
It's naive to think that this
wasn't an available option.

1034
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:08,448
- SHIPLEY: The issue is whether
the agent could have done

1035
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,217
what he said he did.

1036
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,687
The theory that's been brought
forward in a testimony

1037
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:16,089
by the individual
agents that did it,

1038
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:20,260
they were able to manipulate
part of the server

1039
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:23,664
to cough up an address that
shouldn't have been given up

1040
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:26,233
and that address came
back to Iceland.

1041
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,968
And that server there

1042
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,138
was hosting
the Silk Road hidden service.

1043
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,707
I think we're not gonna
know till we go to trial

1044
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:35,776
and we may never know for sure.

1045
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:39,646
- There's always this balance
of, uh, trying to be

1046
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:41,682
forward leaning in your
investigative techniques

1047
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:42,916
and making sure that you don't

1048
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:44,985
trample on rights
at the same time.

1049
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,589
You wanna stay well within the
bounds of your legal authority,

1050
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:51,158
because if you step
over the line,

1051
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,826
the evidence is gonna be tossed.

1052
00:53:52,928 --> 00:53:54,695
It's not gonna be
admissible in court

1053
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:56,630
and you may wind up, uh,

1054
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:59,600
jeopardizing the outcome
of an entire investigation.

1055
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:01,735
And so I think what agencies
will try and do is they'll...

1056
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:03,737
they'll want to step
right up to the line,

1057
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,706
and maybe get a little bit
of chalk on their toes,

1058
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:07,741
but don't step over it.

1059
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:09,676
- REEVES NARRATING:
Ross' lawyer made a motion

1060
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:12,145
to dismiss the case based
on the disputed seizure

1061
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,214
of the Silk Road servers,

1062
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:17,718
arguing that admitting this
material not only violates

1063
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,720
his client's
Fourth Amendment rights,

1064
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:21,455
but would set
a dangerous precedent

1065
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:24,958
for the rights to privacy
of all citizens.

1066
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,761
The judge, Katherine Forest,
sided with the prosecution

1067
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:31,331
stating that the Tarbell
declaration was acceptable.

1068
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:33,233
And the motion was denied.

1069
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,675
Search and seizure law
in the digital age

1070
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:46,913
is really, uh, doesn't have
the limitations on it that,

1071
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,815
um, it does in
the physical space.

1072
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:52,619
And um, we see it not only in
the search and seizure laws,

1073
00:54:52,721 --> 00:54:54,021
like what is
the standard upon which

1074
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:56,256
they can come and grab
your computer?

1075
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:57,658
Um, what kind of
searches can they do

1076
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,760
on your computer
once they have it?

1077
00:54:59,862 --> 00:55:01,194
Do they just get everything?

1078
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,496
We see this at the border.

1079
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:03,930
Or we see this at
searches into arrests.

1080
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,899
People now carry
around smart phones

1081
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:08,568
that have their whole
lives in them.

1082
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,305
And if they get stopped,
law enforcement is...

1083
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,940
is certainly right now in a lot
of places taking the position

1084
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,809
that absolutely anything
that's connected,

1085
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:20,580
that's on that device, including
logging into your accounts

1086
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:24,051
that you can log into from
that device, is fair game.

1087
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:28,288
- If the prosecution gets away
with this warrantless seizure

1088
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,459
of Americans' data as well as
all these other foreigners,

1089
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,828
it could have a lasting
precedent for how

1090
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,397
the Fourth Amendment works
in the digital age.

1091
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:39,099
I think that that, in fact,

1092
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:42,135
may be the most lasting
effect of the Silk Road.

1093
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:45,772
- Generally, what happens
in the criminal law field

1094
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:50,544
is that there's a...some case
of...of major proportion

1095
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:54,081
that is used as a means
of changing rules,

1096
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:57,984
or expanding exceptions to
constitutional protections,

1097
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:00,187
and once it's there,
once the precedent is set,

1098
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:02,723
it then trickles down very
quickly and very easily

1099
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:04,691
into all sorts of
ordinary cases where,

1100
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:06,593
you know, the ends
justify the means.

1101
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,595
Then all of a sudden,
it's now spread.

1102
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:10,464
- The average citizen may say,

1103
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:12,366
"Well, why is this
important to me?

1104
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:13,867
"Why do I care?

1105
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:15,168
"I'm not buying drugs
on the network.

1106
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,270
Nobody I know is buying
drugs on the network,"

1107
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,772
but it's not just about that.

1108
00:56:18,874 --> 00:56:23,877
We're a democracy and informed
citizens, uh, um,

1109
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:26,179
understand they have
a right to privacy

1110
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:29,616
and that the Fourth Amendment
protects against

1111
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:31,485
unreasonable searches
and seizures.

1112
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:33,420
Information has to be encrypted.

1113
00:56:33,522 --> 00:56:35,822
And that goes from
a large corporation

1114
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:37,324
down to an individual.

1115
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:40,761
And so for those who
are arguing that information

1116
00:56:40,863 --> 00:56:42,696
should not be encrypted,

1117
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:45,432
certainly that makes it easier
for law enforcement

1118
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,901
to, um...combat,

1119
00:56:48,003 --> 00:56:50,670
but it also makes it easier for
the cyber criminals to attack.

1120
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:52,706
- It makes total sense
that criminals

1121
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:54,541
are among the early wave,

1122
00:56:54,643 --> 00:56:56,476
along with the sort
of paranoid people,

1123
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:58,345
of these new tools and services.

1124
00:56:58,447 --> 00:56:59,913
But that doesn't mean that

1125
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:01,815
they're the only people
using these services.

1126
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:03,517
You know, there are a hell of
a lot of journalists

1127
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:06,720
that I know and regularly
communicate with now over Tor.

1128
00:57:06,822 --> 00:57:08,355
But you know, for the people

1129
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:11,591
who oppose this technology,
who see it as a threat,

1130
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:13,193
the fact that criminals use it

1131
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,228
is a great way to...
to demonize it.

1132
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,063
- I definitely do believe
that there are people

1133
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:19,232
in the US that don't think
that the government

1134
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:20,934
is doing anything wrong.

1135
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:23,537
It's not necessarily something
that you're concerned with

1136
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:25,372
or that you care too much about

1137
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:26,973
or that you're really
passionate about until you...

1138
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:28,742
you're standing right
in the middle of it.

1139
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:30,010
- And it's something
more dangerous

1140
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,479
than any website could ever be

1141
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:36,283
is what our government has
become and how they operate.

1142
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:38,251
- This goes back to that
question of the government

1143
00:57:38,353 --> 00:57:40,454
kind of trying to treat the
internet differently without,

1144
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:44,991
uh, following the same kind of,
uh, judicial processes.

1145
00:57:45,093 --> 00:57:48,261
- Well the Supreme Court has
proven that they do not agree.

1146
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:50,797
You know, recently with
Riley vs California

1147
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:53,533
with an illegal search
of a cell phone.

1148
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:55,302
Precedent can be set

1149
00:57:55,404 --> 00:57:59,473
that will limit their ability
to infringe on our rights.

1150
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:04,010
- SANDVIK: Someone asked how her
political views have shifted.

1151
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:08,081
Because suddenly she's standing
right in the middle of Tor,

1152
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:13,220
Bitcoin, the war on drugs,
online anonymity, encryption.

1153
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:17,057
And she's had a...she's had to
learn a lot of different things,

1154
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:20,694
and also not only just the whole
legal system but, uh,

1155
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:22,662
everything around
the technology and the case.

1156
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:26,266
- CROWD: [applauding]

1157
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:28,201
- REEVES NARRATING:
After over a year in prison,

1158
00:58:28,303 --> 00:58:30,237
Ross delayed
the trial two months,

1159
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:32,772
stating that important
discovery evidence

1160
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,941
he needed to examine

1161
00:58:35,043 --> 00:58:37,978
had only just been delivered
to him by the prosecution.

1162
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,946
-- The FBI shut down
what it calls

1163
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:43,049
the most sophisticated and
extensive criminal marketplace

1164
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:47,020
on the internet, but it may
be finding new life.

1165
00:58:47,122 --> 00:58:48,388
- REEVES NARRATING:
The arrest of Ross Ulbricht

1166
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,156
and closure of the Silk Road

1167
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:53,660
did nothing to hamper
drug sales on the dark net.

1168
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:55,729
Many new markets
immediately appeared,

1169
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:58,865
including a re-launch of
the Silk Road itself,

1170
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:01,001
also run by someone
calling themselves

1171
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:03,270
the Dread Pirate Roberts.

1172
00:59:03,372 --> 00:59:05,305
And like its predecessor,
the second Silk Road

1173
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:08,141
also claimed a mandate
of reducing violence

1174
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:10,944
and harm in drug transactions.

1175
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,479
- MALE NEWSCASTER:
The Dread Pirate tweets,

1176
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:16,283
"Silk Road while under
my watch will never harm a soul.

1177
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:19,819
If we did, then we are no better
than the thugs on the street."

1178
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:23,089
- The new Dread Pirate Roberts
told me that he knows

1179
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:26,660
he can't be around forever,
and when he's gone,

1180
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,995
someone else...he's
confident someone else

1181
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:30,697
will step up and fill the void.

1182
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,267
You can take down the man, but
you can't take down the idea.

1183
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:35,669
- REEVES NARRATING: By this
time, statistics appeared

1184
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:38,939
claiming the first Silk Road
had succeeded in its mission

1185
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:42,275
of reducing violence
in the drug trade.

1186
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:50,884
- MAN: While I was with
the Baltimore Police Department

1187
00:59:50,986 --> 00:59:52,686
in the early 2000s,

1188
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:54,821
I had two city
officers in uniform

1189
00:59:54,923 --> 00:59:57,490
killed by drug dealers
on the street.

1190
00:59:57,593 --> 00:59:59,292
And there was a family of seven,

1191
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:02,295
the Dawson family
on Preston Street,

1192
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:04,764
they were killed by one drug
dealer in one night--

1193
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:09,035
mother, father and five kids.

1194
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:13,473
And so as the years in the early
2000s start moving along,

1195
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:18,178
I'm continuing to think about
this from a place of violence

1196
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,881
and beginning to realize that
our policies of drug prohibition

1197
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:24,918
were actually counterproductive
to public safety.

1198
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,455
The one thing that I signed
on for to improve,

1199
01:00:28,557 --> 01:00:30,890
to better public safety
in our neighborhoods,

1200
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,626
was making it worse.

1201
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:38,732
And, uh, I found a large number
of police officers and judges

1202
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:42,102
and criminal prosecutors
and DEA agents

1203
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:46,006
and FBI who think the same way.

1204
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:49,909
If Baltimore moved from street
corners to online services,

1205
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:52,145
oh, my God, do you know
how many shootings,

1206
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:53,947
how many fewer shootings
we would have every year,

1207
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:56,249
which equate to fewer homicides?

1208
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,184
Number one, it removes the...

1209
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:04,391
the buyer from the back alleys
and from the street corners

1210
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:07,093
and from those dangerous places
of dealing with the seller.

1211
01:01:07,195 --> 01:01:09,696
Buying it over the internet
where it's delivered to you,

1212
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:11,531
removes you from that scenario.

1213
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:13,733
- Well, one of the interesting
things that having

1214
01:01:13,835 --> 01:01:16,302
an online market
does is that it makes

1215
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,171
sellers much more
accountable to buyers.

1216
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:19,739
And one of the really
interesting innovations

1217
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:21,441
is the whole review system,

1218
01:01:21,543 --> 01:01:25,078
where buyers can review
the sellers and the items

1219
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,948
that they bought from these,
uh, on these market places.

1220
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:31,851
And what that does is it makes
sellers more accountable

1221
01:01:31,953 --> 01:01:33,586
and it lets buyers...

1222
01:01:33,689 --> 01:01:37,090
It gives buyers a way
to assess both the quality,

1223
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:40,527
the purity and the potency of
the drugs they're getting.

1224
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:44,431
It makes, uh, these transactions
much more safe for the buyers.

1225
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:48,802
- But we're shutting them down,
attempting to shut them down,

1226
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:52,405
because we will
never shut them down.

1227
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:55,475
We've been at this drug war
now for over four decades,

1228
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:57,510
and what has happened
since then?

1229
01:01:57,612 --> 01:01:59,479
At the beginning,
it was just the cartels

1230
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:02,182
and organized crime
making a ton of money.

1231
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:06,486
Today, they make globally
$322 billion off this industry.

1232
01:02:06,588 --> 01:02:09,756
Corporate America's
also now in the game.

1233
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:11,791
Private prisons, okay?

1234
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:13,893
Corrections Corporation
of America.

1235
01:02:13,995 --> 01:02:15,528
About a year ago they gave out

1236
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:19,199
$675 million in dividends
to the shareholders.

1237
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:20,967
Drug testing companies.

1238
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:23,570
It's now become
a multi-billion-dollar industry.

1239
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:25,438
And who gets tested?

1240
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,874
Those who are in prison
or under the control

1241
01:02:27,976 --> 01:02:29,943
of our criminal
justice programs--

1242
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,678
on parole and probation.

1243
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,047
So corporate America's
making a lot of money.

1244
01:02:34,149 --> 01:02:35,381
What about law enforcement?

1245
01:02:35,484 --> 01:02:37,517
Law enforcement's
making a ton of money.

1246
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,019
The government's
1033 Program, you know,

1247
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:43,323
where we get armored
vehicles and machine guns

1248
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:46,960
and whatever we want of
the surplus military equipment--

1249
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:48,728
that's because of the drug war.

1250
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:52,232
- Over the years we've seen
these...these huge bureaucracies

1251
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:55,535
build up around the drug war,
around prosecuting the drug war.

1252
01:02:55,637 --> 01:02:57,470
You've got
the Drug Enforcement Agency.

1253
01:02:57,572 --> 01:03:00,206
You've got the Office of
National Drug Control Policy.

1254
01:03:00,308 --> 01:03:03,610
So a lot of the...a lot of
the opposition is just rooted in

1255
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:08,181
self interest among places
like the FBI and the DEA,

1256
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:10,583
where if you're telling somebody
who's been in the FBI

1257
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:14,154
for 30 years that drugs
are no longer a priority,

1258
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:16,222
that's an existential
threat to them.

1259
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:18,491
That kind of takes away their
whole reason for existence.

1260
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:20,426
- You really have
to think about

1261
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:23,263
the danger of some
of these drugs,

1262
01:03:23,365 --> 01:03:26,166
the severe danger of addiction,

1263
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:29,602
uh, the havoc that it, you know,
that it reaps on families

1264
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:33,873
and, you know, and children,
and, uh, careers.

1265
01:03:33,975 --> 01:03:35,441
And so to say that, you know,

1266
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:37,677
we need to step back
and liberalize,

1267
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:40,613
well, but you...that's one
approach you can take,

1268
01:03:40,715 --> 01:03:42,882
but then you've got to look
at a cause and effect.

1269
01:03:42,984 --> 01:03:46,286
If we do this, what are the
second and third order effects?

1270
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,525
- FRANKLIN: The FBI,
our federal government,

1271
01:03:52,627 --> 01:03:54,494
they're gonna go in and they're
shutting these places down.

1272
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,462
But you know what?
New ones just open up.

1273
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:58,698
'Cause there's so much
money to be made.

1274
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,966
They'll continue to open up,

1275
01:04:00,068 --> 01:04:02,836
and it's just
a dog chasing its tail.

1276
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,414
- KIRK ULBRICHT: We're a team,
and we've been working on

1277
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:18,451
this thing together
right from the start.

1278
01:04:18,553 --> 01:04:21,020
The way it's affected me
is in some ways

1279
01:04:21,122 --> 01:04:23,423
very much the same
as it affects Lyn,

1280
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:26,793
but I don't have to go out
there and talk to reporters.

1281
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:29,929
And we've...we've kind
of set it up that way.

1282
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:34,434
- It's hard enough having
your...your loved one in prison,

1283
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:39,105
but then the whole media thing
is, it definitely adds pressure.

1284
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:40,506
- I've known for a long time

1285
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:44,711
that the media wasn't
reporting the whole story,

1286
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:47,347
that it was skewed.

1287
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:55,521
I see what Lyn and I are doing
as a, um, as a pushback to that.

1288
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:57,156
- Ross has been in
there a year and he's...

1289
01:04:57,259 --> 01:05:00,093
he's avoided all violence,

1290
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:02,528
even though it's
been around him.

1291
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:05,798
That has matured him for sure.

1292
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:09,168
The fact that he's come out
of this unscathed so far,

1293
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:12,005
uh, speaks volumes.

1294
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,907
- LYN ULBRICHT:
He seems serious.

1295
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,742
You know, there's
a lot at stake.

1296
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:20,179
He's, uh, feeling good
that we got the extension.

1297
01:05:20,282 --> 01:05:22,849
He had this mountain
of stuff to go through

1298
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:26,552
and I felt like he was
running out the clock.

1299
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:29,989
And now they have that
extra two months has made...

1300
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:32,525
has been "essential"
is the word he used.

1301
01:05:32,627 --> 01:05:34,894
And so I think
he feels that, you know,

1302
01:05:34,996 --> 01:05:38,564
he's...he's much more
prepared and...and ready.

1303
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,967
- Yeah, he says he's
ready for trial.

1304
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:42,969
He's ready to go
in there and win.

1305
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:48,841
I have also matured
in this last year.

1306
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:54,414
Matured in my thinking
about ethics, politics.

1307
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:57,183
When I became
more and more aware of

1308
01:05:57,285 --> 01:06:01,754
what the drug war
was doing, the tragedy.

1309
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:06,025
So many people have been
victimized by the drug war.

1310
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:10,563
It's a giant mess and it's
a story that needs telling.

1311
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:15,668
And we...we've got a pulpit,
in a way, to tell it from.

1312
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,638
- It's so weird to be doing
all this and it's...

1313
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,175
it's distracting and it's...
it's challenging

1314
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:23,409
and you wanna do
the right thing,

1315
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:25,445
and then it's all about Ross.

1316
01:06:25,547 --> 01:06:28,381
And then we go and we see him
and hug him and talk to him

1317
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:32,151
and hold his hand and it's
just like Ross, you know?

1318
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:33,753
It's such a disconnect, and, uh,

1319
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,056
it's just so hard to
see him in there.

1320
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:44,597
- KIRK ULBRICHT:
Being in the prison, visiting,

1321
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:46,399
it's a very emotional
experience,

1322
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:49,302
because there are all
these families there

1323
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:53,339
and they get to see their
loved one one hour a week.

1324
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:56,142
And so they're soaking
each other up.

1325
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:59,078
And you're in a room
of 150 people,

1326
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,647
sitting side-by-side,
tight-packed.

1327
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,351
And, uh, there's just
all this emotion

1328
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:07,854
saturating the atmosphere.

1329
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:23,970
- KIRK ULBRICHT: The prisoners
have segregated themselves.

1330
01:07:24,072 --> 01:07:28,975
But as loved ones coming to
visit, there's no sense of,

1331
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:33,713
uh, segregation, um,
race at all.

1332
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:38,418
We're just 150 people whose
hearts are breaking.

1333
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:56,135
- SOGHOIAN: Of all
the Snowden disclosures

1334
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:57,570
that have come out to date,

1335
01:07:57,672 --> 01:08:00,773
the one that will have
the greatest long-term impact

1336
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:04,043
is the revelation that the NSA
has been subverting

1337
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:07,013
cryptographic standards and
making the internet less secure.

1338
01:08:07,115 --> 01:08:11,284
That disclosure, those articles,
have radicalized

1339
01:08:11,386 --> 01:08:13,586
a new generation
of cryptographers,

1340
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:15,655
a new generation
of computer scientists

1341
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:18,658
who are now intent upon
building tools and services

1342
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,595
that can withstand pervasive
government surveillance.

1343
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:26,499
- Did you see our wireless
from Barclay's Bank?

1344
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:29,035
They like Bitcoin, so they're
supporting our work.

1345
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:32,905
They're providing us with
free Wi-Fi from the bank.

1346
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,177
- REEVES NARRATING:
In the fall of 2014,

1347
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,513
as Ross was preparing
for his trial,

1348
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:42,882
a group of hackers,
programmers and activists

1349
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:46,085
met in a squat in
the center of London.

1350
01:08:46,187 --> 01:08:49,622
This gathering represented
the next wave of the dark net,

1351
01:08:49,724 --> 01:08:52,458
developing new and evolved
cryptographic tools

1352
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,495
that would not be
so easily shut down.

1353
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:57,663
- Open source
is incredibly powerful.

1354
01:08:57,765 --> 01:09:01,134
Open source is responsible for
WikiLeaks, Wikipedia, Linux,

1355
01:09:01,236 --> 01:09:05,104
which runs all of our...
our infrastructure, for Firefox,

1356
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:08,975
for Bit Torrent, for Bitcoin,
for all of these,

1357
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:11,644
for encryption, for all of
these real uses of tech--

1358
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:16,449
not the yuppie, uh,
Angry Birds or silly apps that,

1359
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:19,018
that these people,
make, you know?

1360
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,421
Open source is also an example
of how we can organize

1361
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:26,125
economically, an example
for the future, to...

1362
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:28,361
to build the products we need

1363
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:30,363
without needing
proprietary industry,

1364
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:33,099
without needing
the points of control,

1365
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:38,604
without needing masters
and slaves and babysitters.

1366
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:42,441
- SOGHOIAN: It's not enough to
build privacy-preserving tools.

1367
01:09:42,544 --> 01:09:45,945
It's not enough to write
revolutionary research papers

1368
01:09:46,047 --> 01:09:49,615
and design amazing
cryptographic primitives.

1369
01:09:49,717 --> 01:09:52,485
You have to get them into
the hands of the users.

1370
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:55,755
And I think in the future
what you'll find is that

1371
01:09:55,857 --> 01:10:00,259
tools like Tor, tools like OTR,
like PGP, like Bitcoin

1372
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:03,262
will be built into the services
and applications that you use

1373
01:10:03,364 --> 01:10:06,499
and you won't know
they're there.

1374
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:08,901
- TAAKI: We want to empower
the individual,

1375
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:10,736
protect the small guy.

1376
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:13,573
We have a mistrust
of central authority.

1377
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:15,875
We believe in freedom
of information.

1378
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:18,344
First of all,
we have the centralized

1379
01:10:18,446 --> 01:10:20,680
drug marketplace, Silk Road.

1380
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:23,449
Governments went in
and shut that down.

1381
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:26,686
And then up sprouted
dozens of different,

1382
01:10:26,788 --> 01:10:29,155
centralized drug markets.

1383
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:32,391
And in a game of whack a mole,
they shut down one

1384
01:10:32,493 --> 01:10:34,227
and now there's dozens.

1385
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:36,562
And now we're entering the realm
of decentralized drug markets,

1386
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:39,565
with no central operator,
no central point of control.

1387
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,133
What are they gonna do?

1388
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:45,938
- SHIPLEY: They're gonna
continue to do

1389
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,641
these kinds of things, and even
if it's a distributed network,

1390
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:52,912
peer-to-peer is worked
continuously by the, uh,

1391
01:10:53,014 --> 01:10:54,614
state and local law
enforcement agencies.

1392
01:10:54,716 --> 01:10:57,984
And they arrest
people every week.

1393
01:10:58,086 --> 01:11:01,320
- REEVES NARRATING:
On November 6, 2014,

1394
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:03,356
law enforcement agencies
around the world

1395
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:06,525
launched a coordinated effort
called "Operation Onymous,"

1396
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:08,794
seizing hundreds
of dark net sites,

1397
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,597
including the re-launch
of the Silk Road.

1398
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:13,099
- GREENBERG: Bruce Schneier,
the cryptographer,

1399
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:14,934
once said to me,

1400
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:16,969
"You know, in this
cat and mouse game,

1401
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,472
the mice will win in the end,
but the cats will be well fed."

1402
01:11:19,574 --> 01:11:21,540
I think that that's
the way to see it.

1403
01:11:21,643 --> 01:11:25,811
That, uh, this game is going
to continue forever.

1404
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,134
- WILSON: There's a reason
the Silk Road was so powerful.

1405
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:49,735
And I...and I know the cryptos
now are writing

1406
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:51,837
the kind of automatic Silk Road,
and Amir helped do this.

1407
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:53,939
This is now the peer-to-peer
model where there's

1408
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,242
no one individual
administrator.

1409
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,744
And seeing that as the weak
point, technically speaking,

1410
01:11:58,846 --> 01:12:00,112
this is all correct.

1411
01:12:00,214 --> 01:12:02,415
But there...there's
something kind of...

1412
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:06,085
I don't want to make him
a hero, like a...

1413
01:12:06,187 --> 01:12:07,853
I don't want to say
that he's a hero.

1414
01:12:07,955 --> 01:12:11,123
But you know, DPR recognized
what was at stake

1415
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:13,726
and he was willing to do
the things that most of

1416
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:15,594
the Libertarians
weren't willing to do,

1417
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:19,799
because he was serious about, I
think what the Silk Road meant.

1418
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:23,402
- REEVES NARRATING:
Three weeks before the trial,

1419
01:12:23,504 --> 01:12:27,039
the issue of the Murders-
For-Hire suddenly resurfaced.

1420
01:12:27,141 --> 01:12:30,209
The prosecution announced that
due to these allegations,

1421
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:32,812
they would not allow
Ross's defense to know

1422
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:35,081
the identities of
their witnesses.

1423
01:12:35,183 --> 01:12:37,850
The defense responded that using
these uncharged crimes

1424
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:40,686
in these manner was
prejudicial.

1425
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:44,090
A hearing was called
to resolve the matter.

1426
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,161
- LYN ULBRICHT: The judge ruled
that some of the witnesses

1427
01:12:49,263 --> 01:12:50,863
won't be made available
to the defense

1428
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:53,899
until right before the trial.

1429
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:58,704
It's based on her saying
that Ross might intimidate

1430
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:02,842
or even murder people,
um, from jail.

1431
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:13,753
- WILSON: When all this
first happened, I said,

1432
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:15,755
well, it would still have been
necessary to say that, well,

1433
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:17,123
this man's a murderer and...

1434
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:18,958
and he was only out
for his own gain.

1435
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,627
And you know, he had...
what do you call it,

1436
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:23,963
a callous disregard
for human life.

1437
01:13:24,065 --> 01:13:25,297
It's necessary to paint
a figure that way

1438
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,733
rather than to make him,
you know, a martyr of the...

1439
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:29,468
the war on drugs.

1440
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,137
I think that's just
good planning.

1441
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,339
- I think it's gonna
be difficult, um,

1442
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:34,940
to have a fair trial.

1443
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,176
If you are innocent
until proven guilty,

1444
01:13:37,278 --> 01:13:38,878
then with all the evidence

1445
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,880
and all the stories
that have been written,

1446
01:13:40,982 --> 01:13:42,915
I think it's gonna be
really difficult to...

1447
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:45,885
to find people who are
not influenced by...

1448
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:48,988
by any of this
at all going into it.

1449
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:05,704
- REEVES NARRATING:
The day before the trial,

1450
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,174
Ross provided a written
statement.

1451
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:12,011
It was the closest anyone would
ever get to an actual interview.

1452
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:30,723
- MALE NEWSCASTER: Ross Ulbricht
went on trial today.

1453
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:32,291
A jury will decide a case

1454
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:34,293
that could impact the future
of internet privacy.

1455
01:15:34,395 --> 01:15:35,794
- Good evening to you.

1456
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:37,162
Opening arguments
taking place today,

1457
01:15:37,265 --> 01:15:39,198
and the first witness
took the stand

1458
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,467
and actually just got
off a few minutes ago--

1459
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:45,304
a Homeland Security
investigation special agent

1460
01:15:45,406 --> 01:15:47,206
who testified saying that,

1461
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:52,411
"Thousands of envelopes
of drugs..."

1462
01:15:52,513 --> 01:15:54,980
- GREENBERG: I think everyone
was surprised that Ross Ulbricht

1463
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:57,016
and his lawyers took this
to trial in the first place

1464
01:15:57,118 --> 01:15:59,051
instead of just
taking a plea deal

1465
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:01,253
like pretty much
everyone expected.

1466
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:02,922
And today, we saw why,

1467
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:05,357
which is that they've actually
got a pretty compelling

1468
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:09,295
alternate narrative of how this
whole case has played out.

1469
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:13,065
The story that Dratel
is telling that Ross did create

1470
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,301
the Silk Road, which is an
amazing admission to begin with,

1471
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:17,903
and that the real operator
of the Silk Road,

1472
01:16:18,005 --> 01:16:20,005
the Dread Pirate Roberts,
framed him.

1473
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:23,475
It's a kind of theory that
I never heard posed before,

1474
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:26,445
that instead of Ross being
the Dread Pirate Roberts,

1475
01:16:26,547 --> 01:16:28,647
he was framed by him.

1476
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:31,350
But in many ways, you know, it's
something I should've expected

1477
01:16:31,452 --> 01:16:34,687
because it's what
the Dread Pirate Roberts told me

1478
01:16:34,789 --> 01:16:37,089
when I interviewed
him in July of 2013

1479
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:39,024
that he didn't create
the Silk Road,

1480
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:41,360
that he had inherited
it from its creator,

1481
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:44,163
kind of like a business
acquisition.

1482
01:16:44,265 --> 01:16:47,800
The FBI has told me that that
was Ross Ulbricht lying to me.

1483
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:50,336
If it is a lie, it would
require just a lot of...

1484
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:53,105
a lot of foresight and planning,
kind of like the...

1485
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:58,310
you know, an amazing game
of chess or something.

1486
01:16:58,412 --> 01:17:00,379
- REEVES NARRATING:
In the first days of the trial,

1487
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:02,715
the prosecution presented
evidence that Ross

1488
01:17:02,817 --> 01:17:05,851
kept a journal on his laptop
describing his involvement

1489
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:09,154
in the Silk Road and that the
Bitcoins seized from his laptop

1490
01:17:09,256 --> 01:17:11,190
came directly from the site.

1491
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,559
While the defense would argue
that Ross abandoned

1492
01:17:13,661 --> 01:17:16,128
the Silk Road after creating
it and that the journal

1493
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:19,865
and the Bitcoin were
planted on his laptop.

1494
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:21,433
- MALE NEWSCASTER:
Andy, you interviewed

1495
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,635
the Dread Pirate Roberts.

1496
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:24,203
What's the evidence connecting

1497
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:26,171
Dread Pirate Roberts
to Ulbricht directly?

1498
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:28,073
- GREENBERG: Well, in the first
couple of weeks of this trial,

1499
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:29,475
which is ongoing now,

1500
01:17:29,577 --> 01:17:31,844
we've seen that the prosecution
has a very strong case.

1501
01:17:31,946 --> 01:17:33,012
Once they seized his laptop,

1502
01:17:33,114 --> 01:17:35,014
they found that
he had kept a journal.

1503
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:36,415
If this is, in fact,
Ulbricht's journal.

1504
01:17:36,517 --> 01:17:37,916
His defense claims it's not.
- Right.

1505
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:39,551
- He documented
the administration

1506
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:40,786
of this site for years.

1507
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:42,354
He has a log book
of daily activities.

1508
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:44,957
So this is a really tight
case that's gonna be

1509
01:17:45,059 --> 01:17:48,060
very difficult for Ulbricht
to...to squeeze out of it.

1510
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:51,497
- Underneath, in the deep web,
we have an area

1511
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:53,999
where this young man,
according to the government,

1512
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:56,535
has made a decision that
he's going to run

1513
01:17:56,637 --> 01:18:01,340
an illegal drug empire
and we need to stop you,

1514
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:07,112
swift and certain prosecution,
and ultimate certain punishment.

1515
01:18:07,214 --> 01:18:09,014
- REEVES NARRATING:
As the trial continued,

1516
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:11,817
Dratel planned to reveal
the government's own evidence

1517
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:16,221
showed they suspected multiple
people of running the Silk Road.

1518
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:19,625
During his cross examination of
DHS agent Der-Yeghiayan,

1519
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:23,062
Dratel was able to expose that
the agent had long suspected

1520
01:18:23,164 --> 01:18:25,964
another person to be
the Dread Pirate Roberts,

1521
01:18:26,067 --> 01:18:29,535
going so far as to seek
a warrant for this suspect.

1522
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:32,938
The protection protested this
entire line of questioning

1523
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,040
on the grounds that
it was hearsay.

1524
01:18:35,142 --> 01:18:37,142
The judge sided
with the prosecution

1525
01:18:37,244 --> 01:18:39,144
and Dratel was no longer
allowed to question

1526
01:18:39,246 --> 01:18:41,914
government witnesses about
alternate suspects

1527
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:44,717
that came from
the government's own evidence.

1528
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:47,953
When the time came for Dratel
to begin his defense,

1529
01:18:48,055 --> 01:18:50,355
he intended to use
expert witnesses

1530
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:51,957
to explain that
the complex technology

1531
01:18:52,059 --> 01:18:54,159
behind encryption
and cryptocurrency

1532
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:55,561
made it difficult to prove

1533
01:18:55,663 --> 01:18:59,231
that the journal and
the Bitcoin belonged to Ross.

1534
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,500
The prosecution objected
to these witnesses,

1535
01:19:01,602 --> 01:19:03,969
claiming they should have been
made known earlier in the trial

1536
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,604
and they were not necessary

1537
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:08,140
for the jury's understanding
of the case.

1538
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,743
Once again, the judge sided
with the prosecution,

1539
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:15,347
stating that this case did not
require specialized knowledge.

1540
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:18,150
Without expert witnesses
and unable to pursue

1541
01:19:18,252 --> 01:19:21,086
the government's own evidence
of an alternate DPR,

1542
01:19:21,188 --> 01:19:24,890
Dratel's entire defense
was effectively blocked.

1543
01:19:24,992 --> 01:19:27,159
The trial ended abruptly
the next day.

1544
01:19:34,635 --> 01:19:36,468
The trial of Ross Ulbricht

1545
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,771
raised more questions
than it answered.

1546
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:43,742
Did we really know the full
truth of the Silk Road case?

1547
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:45,744
Would this case set a precedent

1548
01:19:45,846 --> 01:19:49,114
for the warrantless search of
Americans' digital property?

1549
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,383
Whatever the ultimate outcome,
it was clear that

1550
01:19:51,485 --> 01:19:54,553
the fall of the Silk Road
was not the end of a chapter,

1551
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:56,355
but the beginning.

1552
01:19:56,457 --> 01:20:00,592
And the movement to create tools
and services for online privacy

1553
01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:02,594
is stronger than ever.

1554
01:20:02,696 --> 01:20:04,329
- FEMALE NEWSCASTER: The trial
of Silk Road mastermind

1555
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:06,598
Ross Ulbricht concluded
when a jury found him guilty

1556
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,968
on seven different counts
that included three drug charges

1557
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:13,005
as well as computer hacking,
money laundering

1558
01:20:13,107 --> 01:20:14,273
and even a kingpin charge

1559
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:16,608
of continuing a criminal
enterprise.

1560
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,378
Ulbricht faces a minimum
of 30 years behind bars,

1561
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,880
but his defense plans
to appeal this decision.

1562
01:20:21,982 --> 01:20:23,582
- Anyone here, all of us,

1563
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:25,450
are going to be judged
by things for which

1564
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:28,187
there is no attribution
in real life.

1565
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,522
There's only attribution
on the internet

1566
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:34,660
for things to be created,
codified, edited, moved, hacked.

1567
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:37,329
- MAN: Was it a fair trial?
- No, I don't think so.

1568
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:41,934
- GREENBERG: As the actual
verdict was read,

1569
01:20:42,036 --> 01:20:44,369
the word "guilty"
was said seven times.

1570
01:20:44,471 --> 01:20:46,138
Ross was just staring
straight ahead.

1571
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,507
I don't know what
was on his face.

1572
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:51,076
But afterwards he turned
back to look at his family

1573
01:20:51,178 --> 01:20:53,011
and he had this really
heartbreaking

1574
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:54,980
kind of stoic smile.

1575
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:57,549
And he was just...
he wasn't crying,

1576
01:20:57,651 --> 01:21:00,786
but he was just blinking...
like blinking hard.

1577
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:05,724
And, uh, then as he was led
away, his mom said,

1578
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:08,327
"This is not the end."

1579
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:11,730
You know, that was it.

1580
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:17,502
- GREENBERG:
The evidence against Ulbricht

1581
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:20,539
was so powerful and Dratel's
strategy had been

1582
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:22,908
to try to cross examine
every government witness

1583
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:24,376
and to pull out
his alternative story

1584
01:21:24,478 --> 01:21:26,578
through that cross examination.

1585
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,780
And when the judge essentially
shut that down and said

1586
01:21:28,883 --> 01:21:31,683
you have to limit your cross
examination to the scope

1587
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:35,320
of the government's
initial questioning,

1588
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:39,024
that really prevented him from
telling any other story.

1589
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:45,697
- KIRK ULBRICHT: We have
a much more informed perspective

1590
01:21:45,799 --> 01:21:47,466
than the rest of the world.

1591
01:21:47,568 --> 01:21:49,635
Uh, we have meetings
that we've had with Josh

1592
01:21:49,737 --> 01:21:53,805
through the last year and three
months, uh, regular meetings.

1593
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,674
We know about how he felt like

1594
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:58,977
he might win the case,
uh, in cross examination.

1595
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:02,147
Uh, we know that the government,
that his witnesses were...

1596
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:05,717
were, uh, blocked
from testifying.

1597
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:09,621
Um, we were in the courtroom
and we saw what happened and...

1598
01:22:09,723 --> 01:22:16,662
and the...the, uh, the travesty,
the, uh, appalling,

1599
01:22:16,764 --> 01:22:19,197
um, obstruction of justice
that happened.

1600
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,467
- There was 5,000 pages
of government evidence

1601
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:25,737
to do with one witness alone,
Jarod Der-Yeghiayan.

1602
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:27,606
None of that was allowed.

1603
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:30,275
5,000 pages, and it was
dumped on the defense

1604
01:22:30,377 --> 01:22:31,910
10 days before trial.

1605
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:35,314
Another 2,500 pages for other
witnesses was dumped

1606
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:37,215
on the defense
a week before trial.

1607
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:40,519
And it was full of
exculpatory evidence

1608
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:44,323
favorable to Ross that was
not permitted to be used.

1609
01:22:44,425 --> 01:22:49,094
- All this great,
huge field of evidence

1610
01:22:49,196 --> 01:22:52,831
that came out in the 3,500
material, a week before trial,

1611
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:55,600
that was...
[clears throat]

1612
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:57,936
that would help
prove Ross's innocence

1613
01:22:58,038 --> 01:23:01,506
was excluded from being brought
out in the courtroom.

1614
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,475
It would have been
a whole different case.

1615
01:23:03,577 --> 01:23:05,477
This was the trial
that didn't happen.

1616
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:07,245
- The trial that didn't happen.

1617
01:23:07,348 --> 01:23:09,348
- The trial just didn't
happen, because it was only

1618
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:14,386
the prosecution's
narrative that we heard.

1619
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:18,123
- WINTER: So then what
about the hacking

1620
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:19,791
of the Silk Road servers?

1621
01:23:19,893 --> 01:23:21,994
What about the precedent
issue of the case?

1622
01:23:22,096 --> 01:23:23,729
- We didn't get that far.

1623
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:26,665
You know, we didn't get to even
have that kind of public hearing

1624
01:23:26,767 --> 01:23:29,067
where the FBI has to
say how they did it

1625
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:30,235
and then we get to decide

1626
01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:32,804
whether that was
legal or illegal.

1627
01:23:32,906 --> 01:23:34,439
That's maybe the most
frustrating thing about this

1628
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:37,609
case from a legal point of view
is that American law enforcement

1629
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:40,946
hacked a foreign server,
I believe,

1630
01:23:41,048 --> 01:23:43,448
and they didn't have a warrant

1631
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:47,452
and they completely got away
with it and nobody's even...

1632
01:23:47,554 --> 01:23:50,689
nobody even gets to ask any
questions about it.

1633
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:52,891
- WINTER: How is Ross
through all of this?

1634
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,760
- He's an amazing guy.

1635
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:57,529
You know, he's handling this
so much better than I would've.

1636
01:23:57,631 --> 01:24:00,432
I...I don't know how I could've
taken what he's, uh,

1637
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:03,135
put up with and
been subjected to

1638
01:24:03,237 --> 01:24:05,470
in this last year
and three months.

1639
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:08,507
And we pray that, uh...
[sighing]

1640
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:11,076
his spirit won't be
crushed by this.

1641
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:15,347
- GREENBERG: It seems that Ross
conceived of the Silk Road,

1642
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:18,450
that he ran it for its
entire existence online.

1643
01:24:18,552 --> 01:24:21,553
I actually accept that
the government has proven that.

1644
01:24:21,655 --> 01:24:26,158
But Ross Ulbricht is
a fascinating character.

1645
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,160
He invented
this brilliant thing.

1646
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:29,528
He had principles.

1647
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:30,829
He wasn't just a cyber-criminal.

1648
01:24:30,931 --> 01:24:33,165
He wasn't just a drug lord
or a kingpin

1649
01:24:33,267 --> 01:24:35,500
as he's described
in these charges.

1650
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:38,170
He was also an idealistic guy.

1651
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,574
And I'm gonna be conflicted
about both the kind of virtue of

1652
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:44,709
the Silk Road and of
Ross Ulbricht as a person,

1653
01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:46,678
I think, for the rest
of my life.

1654
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,880
I'm not gonna be able to come
to a conclusion about this.

1655
01:25:19,345 --> 01:25:22,714
GOT ANY MORE QUESTIONS
OR SHOULD WE WRAP IT UP?

1656
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,384
YES.

1657
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:29,685
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO OVER
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS?

1658
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32,859
IN ONE SENTENCE.

1659
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:47,672
I'M GOING TO DO A FEW THINGS
BUT ONE SENTENCE ISN'T ENOUGH.

1660
01:25:48,044 --> 01:25:51,643
I'M PRETTY SURE I WANT TO START A FAMILY
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

1661
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:54,847
NICE. OKAY.

1662
01:25:55,349 --> 01:25:59,751
AND -- YEAH, MAKE MORE FRIENDS

1663
01:25:59,953 --> 01:26:03,221
AND CLOSE PEOPLE I LOVE.

1664
01:26:03,489 --> 01:26:08,593
FOCUS ON BEING MORE CONNECTED TO
PEOPLE.

1665
01:26:08,995 --> 01:26:12,932
AND 20 YEARS?

1666
01:26:13,634 --> 01:26:15,903
20 YEARS.

1667
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:22,441
I WANT TO HAVE HAD A
SUBSTANTIAL, POSITIVE IMPACT

1668
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:24,809
ON THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY
BY THAT TIME.

1669
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:27,579
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
LIVE FOREVER?

1670
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:30,881
I THINK IT'S A POSSIBILITY
I HONESTLY DO.

1671
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:33,718
I THINK I MIGHT LIVE FOREVER IN SOME FORM

1672
01:26:33,857 --> 01:26:38,724
BY THAT TIME
WITH TECHNOLOGIES CHANGING SO FAST.

1673
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:41,828
COOL I HOPE I'M GOING THERE.

1674
01:26:42,629 --> 01:26:43,933
SWEET.
